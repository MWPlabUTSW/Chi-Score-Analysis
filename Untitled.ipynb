Here, the insulation scores are high when the square is centered on a subsequence within an insulated region (the blue 'squares' along the diagonal) and low when centered on a subsequence between them. In this sense, the local minima of the insulation scores may represent boundaries between compositionally distinct regions. Execute the cell below to compute the insulation scores for all matrices in corr_matrices and plot the scores for the window size = 12 matrix. "
