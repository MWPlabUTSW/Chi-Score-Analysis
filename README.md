# Chi-Score-Analysis
Code required to run chi-score comparisons of amino acid sequences and intra-sequential analyses of compositional modularity. 

Program is available as a Jupyter Notebook file with three cells of code: one that imports dependencies and defines functions, one where the sequence is input and the analysis is performed, and one where the desired confidence level is selected and the solution is visualized. Matrices and other data collected as part of the analysis can be recalled manually.
